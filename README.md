# Custom my.cnf configuration for MySQL/MariaDB

This file is based on the Gist by Fotis (https://gist.github.com/fevangelou)

Gist info: https://gist.github.com/fevangelou/0da9941e67a9c9bb2596

The trouble we had was that the settings contained in the Gist are not optimised for a custom server setup,
so with some trial an error we have created this mariadb.cnf file which you can use.
